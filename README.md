# psntop
Perl Simple Network Top

Can be used to create a nifty but simple console based dashboard to monitor some network device status. Can use icmp ping or check open port to determine uptime.

Check the screenshot.png file to see how it looks.

# Usage
Move the psntop.conf file to your ~/ (Home Dir) and adjust its contents to contain the servers you want to check
Run "perl -c psntop" to check for any missing perl modules and install those using your method of choice
Run perl psntop to open the dashboard

# Waiting to see your enhancements :-)
